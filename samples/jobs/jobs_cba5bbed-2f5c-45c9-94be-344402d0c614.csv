**DETAILS:**


This is an exclusive backfill of a consultant who has been with the end client for 6\+ years. The team is building and maintaining a customer\-survey–driven application that ingests survey inputs, feeds them into an internal LLM/AI layer, and uses that data to help answer questions, surface insights, and support future customer interactions. The work is centered around application development, not data engineering or model training \- the AI/LLM component is already in place, and the engineer will focus on the application that interacts with it.


To succeed here, the engineer must be a **true full\-stack Python \+ React developer**, able to build front\-end features in React and implement backend services in Python/FastAPI. This is similar to a modern C\#/.NET full\-stack role \- owning work from the API and database layer up through the UI, contributing across the full SDLC, and supporting a production system that underpins an AI\-driven workflow.


This is a hands\-on development role requiring depth in React, not hobby\-level front\-end experience, and strong practical Python engineering skills. It is **pure application development \- not data, analytics, or ML engineering.**

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Build and maintain full\-stack application features in Python (FastAPI strongly preferred; Django/Flask acceptable background).
* Develop and integrate RESTful APIs that support an AI/LLM\-backed survey\-processing application.
* Deliver front\-end features using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with the ability to code live and work through detailed technical problem\-solving.
* Handle database responsibilities \- designing schemas, writing queries, and managing migrations for PostgreSQL/MySQL environments.
* Write automated tests, participate in code reviews, and ensure clean, maintainable code.
* Support the full SDLC from design through deployment and production support.
* Troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and collaborate with stakeholders in a long\-running, business\-critical application environment.

**KEY SKILLS:**

* **React**. Candidates must have at least **2–3 years** of professional experience with React. Personal projects are not sufficient.
* **Python** with **FastAPI** with **1\-2 projects** using it in a professional setting. Django or Flask experience is nice\-to\-have, but not a replacement for that.
* 4\-6\+ years of **full\-stack** software development experience.
* Strong background with **REST APIs**.
* Experience with **PostgreSQL or MySQL** and **ORMs**.
* Proficient with **Git workflows** and CI/CD pipelines.
* Solid understanding of **OOP**, testing, debugging, and clean code practices.

**NICE TO HAVE REQUIREMENTS:**

* Familiarity with **LLM\-based applications**, embeddings, prompt engineering, or AI\-driven analysis.

If you've built LLM\-powered products and thrive at the intersection of customer impact and technical depth, this role is for you.

**The Skillset**
----------------

* Love for coding and continuous learning, especially in the rapidly evolving LLM space
* Resourceful problem\-solver mindset: excel in ambiguous situations and take initiative to define product direction
* Strong TypeScript / Node / Express skills for web services and API design (REST, SSE, WebSockets for streaming)
* Modern web framework expertise (React / TypeScript preferred), particularly for conversational UI and chat interfaces
* Hands\-on LLM experience: OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini APIs, prompt engineering, streaming responses, and conversation context management
* Familiarity with agentic patterns: function calling, tool use (MCP), and orchestrating multi\-step workflows
* API integration skills: consume existing APIs or design new ones to ground AI in investigative data
* Database confidence: PostgreSQL and sophisticated SQL for data retrieval
* Cloud infrastructure basics: Docker, Kubernetes (Helm), AWS services (S3, SQS, API Gateway)
* Product\-minded: translate user feedback into technical requirements and make pragmatic tradeoffs
* Bonus points for: LLM evaluation tools (LangSmith, Langfuse), vector search/RAG, microservices architecture, or Terraform

**About the Role**



Build the Digital Backbone of Modern Manufacturing



We’re assembling a dynamic team to develop and scale our Manufacturing \& Supply Digital Platform—a next\-generation software framework that transforms how manufacturing and supply operations connect, collaborate, and optimize.

  



This platform is not an ERP system. It’s a purpose\-built digital layer that integrates data, processes, and resources across the entire manufacturing lifecycle—from design and engineering to production and distribution.

  



This initiative is powered by NVIDIA technologies, including the Omniverse platform and AI computing capabilities, enabling immersive digital twins, accelerated simulation, and intelligent automation. You’ll be part of a team that’s not just building software—but shaping the future of how manufacturing works through AI\-driven, collaborative, and scalable digital solutions.

  



As part of this initiative, you’ll contribute to:


* System Integration: Seamlessly connecting diverse manufacturing and supply systems, data sources, and workflows into a unified digital ecosystem.
* Data\-Driven Decision Making: Harnessing real\-time data collection, analysis, and visualization to deliver actionable insights and operational intelligence.
* Automation \& Optimization: Driving efficiency through intelligent scheduling, predictive maintenance, and quality control—without replacing core transactional systems.
* Enhanced Collaboration: Enabling transparent communication and coordination across teams, functions, and geographies.

  



If you're passionate about digital platforms, industrial innovation, and working with cutting\-edge technologies—this is your opportunity to make a meaningful impact.

  

This is a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of 3D simulation, AI, and industrial automation, helping us build the next generation of smart factories.

  


**Key Responsibilities**
