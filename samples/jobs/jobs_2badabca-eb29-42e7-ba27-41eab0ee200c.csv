And we do it all with heart, each and every day.

**Position Summary**


We are hiring a Full Stack Staff Software Engineer with strong React and Python experience to join our Data Engineering team. You will take a lead role in the end\-to\-end development of a new, critical internal self\-service application. Your work on this software solution will be instrumental in our initiative to modernize how data is accessed and managed, enabling teams across the company to easily work with their own data through the user\-friendly tools you build. This project involves a shift from traditional data handling processes, with your primary focus being creating a robust application that empowers this new approach to data accessibility and decentralized ownership.

The Data Self\-Service Platform initiative addresses critical challenges in our current data operations. Today, data ingestion is often manual and ticket\-driven, leading to delays and limiting self\-service for our application teams. You’ll help build a platform that empowers data owners to ingest, transform, and serve their data — giving them full control and accountability for data quality. This platform will enable data producers and consumers to collaborate efficiently, address issues directly, and streamline testing changes.


Key Responsibilities:


* Design, develop, and maintain a full\-stack application using React (TypeScript) and Python.
* Build out frontend interfaces and backend services — including data models, APIs, caching, and observability.

* Familiarity with Terraform for infrastructure\-as\-code.
* Exposure to CQRS, Domain\-Driven Design, and MediatR.
* Knowledge of structured logging, retry policies, and health check integrations.
* Understanding of security concepts like JWT, Okta, and policy\-based auth.
* Experience with DBT (Data Build Tool).

 **Education**

* Bachelor of Science in Computer Science or a related field.

**Pay Range**

	+ **Engineer for scale and quality:** Write robust, high\-quality, and maintainable software using modern technologies and engineering standards.
	+ **Leverage AI\-native tools:** Use AI\-assisted development, prototyping, and testing workflows to increase velocity and creativity.
	+ **Shape the culture:** Help build a high\-trust, high\-autonomy engineering culture modeled after modern startups.
	+ **Continuously learn:** Stay on the cutting edge of software, AI, and product development practices \- and share that knowledge with the team.

### **What You'll Bring**

* + 6\+ years of software engineering experience, ideally in full\-stack or product\-engineering roles.
	+ Experience building and scaling user\-facing products, ideally from early concept to launch.
	+ Proficiency in one or more modern programming languages (e.g. TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, or C\#, Golang) and comfort working across the stack.
	+ Experience with React/Typescript, React Native, or similar frameworks is a plus.
	+ Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and modern delivery practices (CI/CD, containers, automated testing).
	+ Strong product sense \- the ability to translate user needs and product goals into technical solutions.
	+ Passion for AI tools and workflows \- you use them to work smarter and faster.
	+ Curiosity, autonomy, and bias for action \- you don’t wait for direction to make progress.
	+ Excellent collaboration and communication skills; ability to work in cross\-functional, distributed teams.

### **About the team**

* + This new team is being built to operate like a startup within Xero \- small, fast\-moving, and entrepreneurial. We combine Xero’s scale and data advantage with a lean mindset, embracing modern AI\-assisted development practices. You’ll help define the engineering foundations, product direction, and culture from day one.
	+ Diversity of people brings diversity of thought \- and we love that. Xero’s human\-first culture of respect, fairness, and inclusion helps every Xero thrive at work and beyond.

* Communicate clearly across technical and non\-technical stakeholders.

### **4\. Own the End\-to\-End Lifecycle**

* Lead each AI Employee from ideation and prototyping to deployment and iterative improvement.
* Prioritize enhancements based on customer impact, operational data, and business outcomes.
* Ensure solutions meet enterprise\-grade requirements for reliability, performance, and usability.

### **5\. Drive Customer Value \& Adoption**

* Act as a strategic partner to customers, ensuring AI Employees deliver measurable ROI.
* Facilitate training, demos, and stakeholder alignment across customer organizations.
* Advocate internally on behalf of customers, ensuring their evolving needs inform enhancements.

### **6\. Optimize Continuously**

* Analyze operational and performance data to identify improvement opportunities.
* Continuously refine agent behaviors, workflows, and decision paths.

* 4\+ years in product management, consulting, engagement management, or a founder/operator role.
* Proven experience working directly with senior stakeholders in enterprise environments.
* Strong ability to map, analyze, and redesign complex business workflows.

**Behavioural fit** is also important at Sleek, and we will be looking for candidates that have a proven track record of embodying the below attributes in their recent roles:

**Ownership:** This shows reliability and helps build trust within the team. We move fast and need to know that everyone will see things through to completion and proactively help to get things back on track when challenges arise. Accountability is really important to us.

**Humility:** There is so much we don’t know. Humility allows for open\-mindedness to feedback and a willingness to learn from others. It paves the way for collaboration and creates a positive work environment. It is a key ingredient of self awareness and emotional intelligence.

**Structured Thinking:** Our business is complex with many layers (many services, many countries, many cultures). Regardless of whether you’re more analytical or creative in nature, being able to show sound judgement is important to us. It ensures solutions are pragmatic and balance the needs of the organisation, team and customers.

**Attention to detail:** You’ll be managing multiple, complex workstreams from numerous stakeholders. It will be important for you to keep track of everything and notice when information is missing or inconsistent.

**Excellent listener and clear communicator:** We have a variety of nationalities and for many people, English isn’t their first language. For you to excel, you’ll need to be present in your calls and make sure you properly receive and thoughtfully send messages to others in the business.

**Analytical Mindset:** You have a keen eye for detail and a methodical approach to dissecting problems. You excel at analysing complex systems and processes to identify weaknesses and inefficiencies, and your ability to evaluate multiple scenarios enables you to devise the best testing strategies. You apply data\-driven decisions to enhance testing coverage and performance metrics, ensuring the highest standards of software quality.

**Collaboration\-Driven:** You thrive in a cross\-functional team environment, working closely with developers, product managers, and operations teams to ensure alignment on requirements and testing goals. You communicate effectively, advocate for quality throughout the development process, and proactively address potential issues before they arise, fostering a culture of shared responsibility for delivering exceptional software.

**Data driven:** We are a data rich business with \~15,000 small customers. Each decision we make can impact many more people than we realise \- so it’s critical that we use sound data to support our strategies and review the success of our initiatives.  

Can have tough conversations in a positive way: It’s not a matter of if, but when difficult interpersonal situations arise. Disagreement, conflict and disappointment are a given in a fast moving business where people care about their work. People that proactively have tough conversations with kindness build empathy, trust and great working relationships.
