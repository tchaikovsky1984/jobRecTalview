We’re not an agency. We’re not a studio. We’re a machine for launching iconic consumer  
brands—again and again and again.

Novus Brands is a new kind of holdco: data\-led, creative\-obsessed, and built for speed. We launch multiple new brands per quarter across beauty, wellness, food, pet, and beyond. Think of us like if Y Combinator and Liquid Death had a baby—and that baby was raised on TikTok, not spreadsheets.

Our process blends fast feedback loops with a deep love for storytelling. We let the data tell us what to build, then we wrap it in beautiful, punch\-you\-in\-the\-face brand experiences. The goal? Build a billion\-dollar shelf of products people actually want, delivered in ways they’ll never forget.

Now we’re looking for a one\-person creative wrecking crew.

**The Role: Full\-Stack Creative (Design \+ Video)**

We’re hiring a hybrid creative who can do both: cut direct\-response video ads and design high\-converting static graphics across multiple consumer brands.

This is a 20–25 hr/week contractor role to start, with the potential to scale to full\-time as Novus launches more brands. You’ll be on weekly creative sprints—designing, editing, iterating, and shipping. Fast.

This is not a role for someone who wants to be “creative adjacent.” This is a hands\-on, performance\-first creative role for someone who can balance design eye with data—and wants to ship at volume.

**What You’ll Do**

* Cut and edit short\-form ads for TikTok, Meta, and YouTube (direct\-response style)
* Design static and motion graphics for paid ads, landing pages, email, and socials
* Adapt to different brand aesthetics—but always keep conversion at the core
* Create and iterate 10\+ versions of the same creative concept, testing variations
* Analyze performance data and evolve creative based on what’s working
* Join weekly creative sprints and deliver assets on tight deadlines
* Balance multiple brands and multiple deliverables at once
* Use AI or automation tools when helpful to boost speed and quality

**What We’re Looking For**

* Strong design eye \+ strong editing chops
* Tools: Premiere, Final Cut, CapCut Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Figma (or similar)
* Deep knowledge of e\-commerce ad trends across Meta, TikTok Shop, and YouTube
* Obsessed with what scroll\-stops, sells, and scales
* Fast turnaround. Comfortable producing dozens of creative variations quickly
* Not precious about your work. You ship, test, iterate, move on
* Zero handholding. You’re proactive, organized, and own your output
* Can manage 20–25 hrs/week consistently with potential to scale

**What Success Looks Like**

* Ad creatives that convert and scale
* Weekly drops of new, tested assets across multiple brands
* Clear creative iteration cycles based on real data
* A growing creative system that drives down CAC and boosts performance across the board
* You becoming the go\-to creative engine powering launches inside Novus

**Comp \& Commitment**

* $1,500/month contractor retainer
* Brand\-by\-brand profit share
* 20–25 hrs/week to start
* Weekly creative sprints
* Room to scale to full\-time as we grow

**Why Now**

We’re building an iconic brand launch engine on the internet \- and creative is the fuel. This isn’t a side gig. This is a chance to shape dozens of brands and build a portfolio that punches way above your weight. If you’ve got the design chops, editing skills, and hustle to match \- let’s go.

**How to Apply:**

**Email:** drew@novusbrands.co  
**Subject:** Full\-Stack Creative – \[Your Name]  
**Include:** Your portfolio, ads, TikToks, static designs, motion graphics—whatever shows us what you can do.

* **Cross\-Functional Alignment:** Work closely with Product and Design to translate priorities into actionable engineering tasks.
* **Quality \& Delivery:** Ensure technical deliverables meet design intent, performance, and reliability standards.
* **Reporting \& Transparency:** Provide clear visibility into status, risks, and dependencies across all engineering efforts.

**Qualifications**

* 6\+ years of experience in engineering or technical program management, ideally in startup or high\-velocity environments.
* Strong technical background — capable of reading and understanding code, system architecture, and ML pipelines.
* Proven success driving complex technical programs end\-to\-end, from planning to production.
* Solid understanding of modern software practices (Agile, DevOps, CI/CD).
* Excellent organizational and communication skills; able to keep teams aligned and focused under pressure.
* Comfortable working directly with executive leadership and small, fast\-moving teams.
* Experience in AI/ML, computer vision, or large\-scale data systems.
* Prior hands\-on software development experience (Python, C\+\+, or similar).
* Familiarity with LLM/VLM development, model integration, or cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure).

**About Vanta**


We started in 2018, in the wake of several high\-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast\-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security. From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged.


Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point\-in\-time check— is essential. Thousands of companies rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust— all in a way that's real\-time and transparent.",,https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Overview/W-EI_IE3971334.htm,https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/3971334/vanta-squareLogo-1681314122921.png,,,,,,,,,,,

This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together.

**Our Approach to Flexible Work**  



With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in\-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in\-office each week, we simply **spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field** with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.
