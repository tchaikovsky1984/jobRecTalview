We are hiring a Full Stack Staff Software Engineer with strong React and Python experience to join our Data Engineering team. You will take a lead role in the end\-to\-end development of a new, critical internal self\-service application. Your work on this software solution will be instrumental in our initiative to modernize how data is accessed and managed, enabling teams across the company to easily work with their own data through the user\-friendly tools you build. This project involves a shift from traditional data handling processes, with your primary focus being creating a robust application that empowers this new approach to data accessibility and decentralized ownership.

**About this Role:**


This is a high\-impact, high\-autonomous role is suited for a detail\-oriented and collaborative individual who thrives on ownership, knows how to apply best practices, and can independently design, build, and maintain production\-grade software.
