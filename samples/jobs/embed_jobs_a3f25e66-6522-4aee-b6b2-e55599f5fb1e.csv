* **ROLE TITLE**: Senior Python/React Engineer
* **MAXIMUM RATE**: Around $82/hour. If the candidate is a perfect match for the role, our client might go higher. This rate applies to corporate\-to\-corporate or 1099 structures. A W\-2 structure is possible, but the rate would need to be adjusted to cover employer costs (ask for a quote).
* **PAYMENT TERMS**: Payments are cut bi\-weekly with ""Paid when Paid"" terms (meaning we'll pay the same day we receive payment from the end\-client). Typically, this client pays monthly around NET30\.
* **START / END**: ASAP to 05/01/2026 (six months), with high odds of extension.
* **WORK AUTHORIZATION**: US Citizens or Green Card only (no H1, OPT, GC EAD, etc.)
* **WORK ARRANGEMENT**:
	+ 100% Remote from within the US.
	+ Preference given to candidates who are in Wisconsin, Minnesota, or Texas. An ideal candidate will be within commuting distance of the Twin Cities.
* **CLIENT LOCATION**: Minneapolis, MN
* **SUBMISSIONS DUE**: 11/27/25 4PM CST

**DETAILS:**


This is an exclusive backfill of a consultant who has been with the end client for 6\+ years. The team is building and maintaining a customer\-survey–driven application that ingests survey inputs, feeds them into an internal LLM/AI layer, and uses that data to help answer questions, surface insights, and support future customer interactions. The work is centered around application development, not data engineering or model training \- the AI/LLM component is already in place, and the engineer will focus on the application that interacts with it.


To succeed here, the engineer must be a **true full\-stack Python \+ React developer**, able to build front\-end features in React and implement backend services in Python/FastAPI. This is similar to a modern C\#/.NET full\-stack role \- owning work from the API and database layer up through the UI, contributing across the full SDLC, and supporting a production system that underpins an AI\-driven workflow.


This is a hands\-on development role requiring depth in React, not hobby\-level front\-end experience, and strong practical Python engineering skills. It is **pure application development \- not data, analytics, or ML engineering.**

**Key Responsibilities:**

* Build and maintain full\-stack application features in Python (FastAPI strongly preferred; Django/Flask acceptable background).
* Develop and integrate RESTful APIs that support an AI/LLM\-backed survey\-processing application.
* Deliver front\-end features using React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with the ability to code live and work through detailed technical problem\-solving.
* Handle database responsibilities \- designing schemas, writing queries, and managing migrations for PostgreSQL/MySQL environments.
* Write automated tests, participate in code reviews, and ensure clean, maintainable code.
* Support the full SDLC from design through deployment and production support.
* Troubleshoot issues, optimize performance, and collaborate with stakeholders in a long\-running, business\-critical application environment.

**KEY SKILLS:**

* **React**. Candidates must have at least **2–3 years** of professional experience with React. Personal projects are not sufficient.
* **Python** with **FastAPI** with **1\-2 projects** using it in a professional setting. Django or Flask experience is nice\-to\-have, but not a replacement for that.
* 4\-6\+ years of **full\-stack** software development experience.
* Strong background with **REST APIs**.
* Experience with **PostgreSQL or MySQL** and **ORMs**.
* Proficient with **Git workflows** and CI/CD pipelines.
* Solid understanding of **OOP**, testing, debugging, and clean code practices.

**NICE TO HAVE REQUIREMENTS:**

* Familiarity with **LLM\-based applications**, embeddings, prompt engineering, or AI\-driven analysis.

**HOW TO APPLY:**

=================


Flock Safety is the leading safety technology platform, helping communities thrive by taking a proactive approach to crime prevention and security. Our hardware and software suite connects cities, law enforcement, businesses, schools, and neighborhoods in a nationwide public\-private safety network. Trusted by over 5,000 communities, 4,500 law enforcement agencies, and 1,000 businesses, Flock delivers real\-time intelligence while prioritizing privacy and responsible innovation.


We’re a high\-performance, low\-ego team driven by urgency, collaboration, and bold thinking. Working at Flock means tackling big challenges, moving fast, and continuously improving. It’s intense but deeply rewarding for those who want to make an impact.


With nearly $700M in venture funding and a $7\.5B valuation, we’re scaling intentionally and seeking top talent to help build the impossible. If you value teamwork, ownership, and solving tough problems, Flock could be the place for you.

**The Opportunity**
-------------------


We're hiring a Senior Software Engineer to build Night Shift, a conversational AI assistant that helps investigators surface critical evidence and close cases faster. You'll design and implement the conversational interface, build the orchestration backend that manages LLM interactions and tool calling, and develop integration pipelines connecting our AI to Flock's existing data platform and APIs. This is a ground\-floor opportunity where product thinking matters as much as technical execution: you'll shape chat experiences with complex context management, partner with platform teams to design new APIs or leverage existing ones, and solve the reliability challenges of deploying AI in high\-stakes investigative workflows. You'll collaborate closely with ML engineers on prompt engineering and agentic workflows while maintaining a strong point of view on what makes a great user experience. If you've built LLM\-powered products and thrive at the intersection of customer impact and technical depth, this role is for you.

**The Skillset**
----------------

* Love for coding and continuous learning, especially in the rapidly evolving LLM space
* Resourceful problem\-solver mindset: excel in ambiguous situations and take initiative to define product direction
* Strong TypeScript / Node / Express skills for web services and API design (REST, SSE, WebSockets for streaming)
* Modern web framework expertise (React / TypeScript preferred), particularly for conversational UI and chat interfaces
* Hands\-on LLM experience: OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini APIs, prompt engineering, streaming responses, and conversation context management
* Familiarity with agentic patterns: function calling, tool use (MCP), and orchestrating multi\-step workflows
* API integration skills: consume existing APIs or design new ones to ground AI in investigative data
* Database confidence: PostgreSQL and sophisticated SQL for data retrieval
* Cloud infrastructure basics: Docker, Kubernetes (Helm), AWS services (S3, SQS, API Gateway)
* Product\-minded: translate user feedback into technical requirements and make pragmatic tradeoffs
* Bonus points for: LLM evaluation tools (LangSmith, Langfuse), vector search/RAG, microservices architecture, or Terraform
