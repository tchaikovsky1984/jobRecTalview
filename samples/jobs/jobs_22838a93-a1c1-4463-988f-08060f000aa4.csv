**Behavioural fit** is also important at Sleek, and we will be looking for candidates that have a proven track record of embodying the below attributes in their recent roles:

**Ownership:** This shows reliability and helps build trust within the team. We move fast and need to know that everyone will see things through to completion and proactively help to get things back on track when challenges arise. Accountability is really important to us.

**Humility:** There is so much we don’t know. Humility allows for open\-mindedness to feedback and a willingness to learn from others. It paves the way for collaboration and creates a positive work environment. It is a key ingredient of self awareness and emotional intelligence.

**Structured Thinking:** Our business is complex with many layers (many services, many countries, many cultures). Regardless of whether you’re more analytical or creative in nature, being able to show sound judgement is important to us. It ensures solutions are pragmatic and balance the needs of the organisation, team and customers.

**Attention to detail:** You’ll be managing multiple, complex workstreams from numerous stakeholders. It will be important for you to keep track of everything and notice when information is missing or inconsistent.

**Excellent listener and clear communicator:** We have a variety of nationalities and for many people, English isn’t their first language. For you to excel, you’ll need to be present in your calls and make sure you properly receive and thoughtfully send messages to others in the business.

**Analytical Mindset:** You have a keen eye for detail and a methodical approach to dissecting problems. You excel at analysing complex systems and processes to identify weaknesses and inefficiencies, and your ability to evaluate multiple scenarios enables you to devise the best testing strategies. You apply data\-driven decisions to enhance testing coverage and performance metrics, ensuring the highest standards of software quality.

**Collaboration\-Driven:** You thrive in a cross\-functional team environment, working closely with developers, product managers, and operations teams to ensure alignment on requirements and testing goals. You communicate effectively, advocate for quality throughout the development process, and proactively address potential issues before they arise, fostering a culture of shared responsibility for delivering exceptional software.

**Data driven:** We are a data rich business with \~15,000 small customers. Each decision we make can impact many more people than we realise \- so it’s critical that we use sound data to support our strategies and review the success of our initiatives.  

Can have tough conversations in a positive way: It’s not a matter of if, but when difficult interpersonal situations arise. Disagreement, conflict and disappointment are a given in a fast moving business where people care about their work. People that proactively have tough conversations with kindness build empathy, trust and great working relationships.
