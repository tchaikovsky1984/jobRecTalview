At RRelocate, we partner with high\-growth startups across the U.S. to match them with exceptional talent. We looking for an experienced **Account Executive** who is excited to drive new business at a fast\-growing startup with a standout product in an industry ripe for innovation. You’ll also play a key role in shaping and scaling the AE team as the company continues rapid expansion.

This role requires a quick learner with strong sales instincts—someone who can confidently engage in financial, real estate–focused conversations while also explaining technical product details clearly to non\-technical buyers.

You will navigate diverse buyer journeys: fast\-moving, single\-stakeholder deals as well as complex, multi\-party enterprise sales involving national commercial real estate firms. Working closely with SDRs, you’ll build a pipeline from scratch and own the sales cycle end\-to\-end to consistently exceed quota.

The ideal candidate has demonstrated success selling into “the real America,” showing growth, promotions, and high performance throughout their career—not just selling SaaS to other tech companies.

You’ll be joining a high\-performing AE team currently reporting directly to the CEO.

**What You’ll Do**

* Exceed quarterly sales quota through full\-cycle selling: prospecting, cold calling, running personalized demos, managing objections, and closing deals.
* Partner with SDRs to expand outbound efforts and grow your active pipeline.
* Quickly become an expert on the product, customer pain points, and how the solution drives measurable value.
* Learn the parking and commercial real estate industry to negotiate pricing and contract terms effectively.
* Maintain an accurate, thorough Salesforce pipeline with exceptional attention to detail.
* Collaborate with Operations through deal desk to craft winning proposals aligned with business goals.
* Help refine and improve the overall sales process as the team scales.

**Who You Are**

* You’re deeply customer\-focused and driven to win deals the right way—creating outcomes that benefit the customer, yourself, and the business.
* You have experience selling in fast\-growing, early\-stage startups with mid\-market or enterprise sales cycles (60–90 days).
* You obsess over understanding the product and can confidently answer detailed questions for non\-technical buyers.
* You consistently apply strong sales methodology and run a disciplined, repeatable sales process.
* You thrive without a perfect playbook and adapt quickly in a changing startup environment.

**What You Need**

* **4–8 years** in full\-cycle, quota\-carrying sales roles, with recent experience as an Account Executive.
* Strong history of promotions and performance.
* Comfort learning new markets quickly—especially commercial real estate.
* Growth mindset, grit, and a hunter mentality.
* Excellent communication skills (written and verbal).
* Ability to run basic financial/profit analyses in Excel.
* Experience in smaller startup environments where processes evolve rapidly.

proficiency in data manipulation and presentation. Key responsibilities include supporting the sales organization through data analysis, developing sales strategies, and optimizing operational processes. This necessitates a deep understanding of sales metrics and performance indicators, as well as the ability to translate data insights into actionable recommendations. Essential technical skills include advanced proficiency in spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets for data analysis, modeling, and reporting. Experience with CRM systems like Salesforce is also crucial for managing sales pipelines and understanding customer data. Furthermore, the candidate should possess strong data visualization skills to effectively communicate complex information to stakeholders, possibly using tools like Tableau or Power BI. A solid grasp of statistical concepts and their application in a business context is beneficial for informed decision-making. The role demands individuals who can independently analyze large datasets, identify trends, and propose data-driven solutions to enhance sales effectiveness and operational efficiency. While soft skills are always valued, this analysis strictly focuses on the hard, technical, and measurable requirements essential for performing the core duties of the position. The ability to work with and interpret sales data, build models, and communicate findings clearly are paramount."
