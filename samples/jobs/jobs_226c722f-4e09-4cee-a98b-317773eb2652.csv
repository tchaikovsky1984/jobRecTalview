As the nation’s leading health solutions company, we reach millions of Americans through our local presence, digital channels and more than 300,000 purpose\-driven colleagues – caring for people where, when and how they choose in a way that is uniquely more connected, more convenient and more compassionate. And we do it all with heart, each and every day.

**Position Summary**


We are hiring a Full Stack Staff Software Engineer with strong React and Python experience to join our Data Engineering team. You will take a lead role in the end\-to\-end development of a new, critical internal self\-service application. Your work on this software solution will be instrumental in our initiative to modernize how data is accessed and managed, enabling teams across the company to easily work with their own data through the user\-friendly tools you build. This project involves a shift from traditional data handling processes, with your primary focus being creating a robust application that empowers this new approach to data accessibility and decentralized ownership.

**About this Role:**


This is a high\-impact, high\-autonomous role is suited for a detail\-oriented and collaborative individual who thrives on ownership, knows how to apply best practices, and can independently design, build, and maintain production\-grade software. While you'll be leveraging your core software engineering expertise, you'll also be at the forefront of our data modernization, gaining deep insights into modern data architectures and practices by building the tools that enable them. You will have access to AI tooling to assist in all aspects of the SDLC.

* 2\+ years’ experience working with REST and API development.
* 2\+ years testing experience — including unit, integration, and mocking frameworks.

 **Preferred Qualifications**

* Experience working with Cursor AI, AI\-enhanced development environments, or modular automation tools like MCPs.
* Familiarity with Terraform for infrastructure\-as\-code.
* Exposure to CQRS, Domain\-Driven Design, and MediatR.
* Knowledge of structured logging, retry policies, and health check integrations.
* Understanding of security concepts like JWT, Okta, and policy\-based auth.
* Experience with DBT (Data Build Tool).

 **Education**

* Bachelor of Science in Computer Science or a related field.

* Build **policy\-driven safety systems** for handling sensitive data, user content, and edge cases with clear escalation paths.
* Balance **safety, user experience, and helpfulness**, knowing when to block, rephrase, or gracefully decline responses.

  

**4\. Multi\-Agent Systems \& Orchestration**  

* Design and operate **multi\-agent workflows** using orchestration frameworks such as **LangGraph**, **AutoGen**, **CrewAI**, or **Haystack**.
* Coordinate routing logic, task delegation, and parallel vs. sequential agent execution to handle complex reasoning or multi\-step tasks.
* Build observability and debugging tools for tracking agent interactions, performance, and cost optimization.
* Evaluate trade\-offs around **latency, reliability, and scalability** in production\-grade multi\-agent environments.

  

**Minimum Qualifications**  

* Strong proficiency in **Python** (FastAPI, Flask, asyncio) and GCP experience is good to have
* Demonstrated **hands\-on RAG implementation experience** with specific tools, models, and evaluation metrics.
* Practical knowledge of **agentic frameworks** (LangGraph, LangChain) and **evaluation ecosystems** (LangFuse, LangSmith).
* Excellent **communication skills**, proven ability to **collaborate cross\-functionally**, and a **low\-ego, ownership\-driven** work style.

  

  

**Preferred / Good\-to\-Have Qualifications**  

* Experience in **traditional AI/ML workflows** — e.g., model training, feature engineering, and deployment of ML models (scikit\-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
* Familiarity with **retrieval optimization**, **prompt tuning**, and **tool\-use evaluation**.
* Background in **observability and performance profiling** for large\-scale AI systems.
* Understanding of **security and privacy** principles for AI systems (PII redaction, authentication/authorization, RBAC)
* Exposure to **enterprise chatbot systems**, **LLMOps pipelines**, and **continuous model evaluation** in production.

**Role Overview**

As an **Agentic Solutions Product Manager**, you will work at the intersection of product strategy, enterprise workflow design, and advanced agentic AI systems.

* Design intuitive human\-in\-the\-loop interfaces for oversight, exception handling, and control.
* Collaborate with engineering to define capabilities, agent behaviors, APIs, and system integrations.
* Ensure AI Employees are scalable, reliable, and aligned with enterprise constraints.

### **3\. Bridge Business Needs \& Engineering Execution**

* Convert ambiguous business goals into crisp, actionable product specifications.
* Evaluate architectural trade\-offs and collaborate with engineering to make critical design decisions.
* Communicate clearly across technical and non\-technical stakeholders.

### **4\. Own the End\-to\-End Lifecycle**

* Lead each AI Employee from ideation and prototyping to deployment and iterative improvement.
* Prioritize enhancements based on customer impact, operational data, and business outcomes.
* Ensure solutions meet enterprise\-grade requirements for reliability, performance, and usability.

### **5\. Drive Customer Value \& Adoption**

* Act as a strategic partner to customers, ensuring AI Employees deliver measurable ROI.
* Facilitate training, demos, and stakeholder alignment across customer organizations.
* Advocate internally on behalf of customers, ensuring their evolving needs inform enhancements.

### **6\. Optimize Continuously**

* Analyze operational and performance data to identify improvement opportunities.
* Continuously refine agent behaviors, workflows, and decision paths.
* Discover new leverage points where agentic AI can extend automation depth or expand coverage.

**Required Skills \& Qualifications**
-------------------------------------

* 4\+ years in product management, consulting, engagement management, or a founder/operator role.
* Proven experience working directly with senior stakeholders in enterprise environments.
* Strong ability to map, analyze, and redesign complex business workflows.
* Ability to engage in technical discussions around architecture, APIs, and agentic design patterns.
* Demonstrated capability to operate independently with high agency and ownership.
* Strong systems thinking: ability to understand and design holistic multi\-component solutions.
* Excellent communication skills with the ability to translate between business and engineering.

**Preferred Skills**

* Familiarity with agile methodologies, backlog tools, and lightweight technical documentation.
* Strong analytical skills; ability to interpret data and turn insights into product decisions.
* Technical background in CS, engineering, mathematics, or equivalent practical experience.

**Why Join Ema**
----------------

* Lead operations for cutting\-edge AI systems redefining enterprise productivity.
* Work closely with world\-class AI engineers, product builders, and enterprise innovators.
* High\-impact leadership role driving the scalability of Ema’s agentic AI platform.
* Hybrid work model enabling collaboration across Silicon Valley and Bangalore.
* Competitive compensation, performance incentives, and rapid growth potential.

**Ema’s Culture \& Values**
---------------------------

* **High Bar on Quality** – We value excellence and expect world\-class execution.
* **Ownership \& Accountability** – We take full responsibility for our outcomes.
* **Impact\-Driven Approach** – We measure success through tangible enterprise value.
* **Collaboration \& Learning** – We learn fast, share knowledge, and grow together.

**Behavioural fit** is also important at Sleek, and we will be looking for candidates that have a proven track record of embodying the below attributes in their recent roles:

**Ownership:** This shows reliability and helps build trust within the team. We move fast and need to know that everyone will see things through to completion and proactively help to get things back on track when challenges arise. Accountability is really important to us.

**Humility:** There is so much we don’t know. Humility allows for open\-mindedness to feedback and a willingness to learn from others. It paves the way for collaboration and creates a positive work environment. It is a key ingredient of self awareness and emotional intelligence.

**Structured Thinking:** Our business is complex with many layers (many services, many countries, many cultures). Regardless of whether you’re more analytical or creative in nature, being able to show sound judgement is important to us. It ensures solutions are pragmatic and balance the needs of the organisation, team and customers.

**Attention to detail:** You’ll be managing multiple, complex workstreams from numerous stakeholders. It will be important for you to keep track of everything and notice when information is missing or inconsistent.

**Excellent listener and clear communicator:** We have a variety of nationalities and for many people, English isn’t their first language. For you to excel, you’ll need to be present in your calls and make sure you properly receive and thoughtfully send messages to others in the business.

**Analytical Mindset:** You have a keen eye for detail and a methodical approach to dissecting problems. You excel at analysing complex systems and processes to identify weaknesses and inefficiencies, and your ability to evaluate multiple scenarios enables you to devise the best testing strategies. You apply data\-driven decisions to enhance testing coverage and performance metrics, ensuring the highest standards of software quality.

**Collaboration\-Driven:** You thrive in a cross\-functional team environment, working closely with developers, product managers, and operations teams to ensure alignment on requirements and testing goals. You communicate effectively, advocate for quality throughout the development process, and proactively address potential issues before they arise, fostering a culture of shared responsibility for delivering exceptional software.

**Data driven:** We are a data rich business with \~15,000 small customers. Each decision we make can impact many more people than we realise \- so it’s critical that we use sound data to support our strategies and review the success of our initiatives.  

Can have tough conversations in a positive way: It’s not a matter of if, but when difficult interpersonal situations arise. Disagreement, conflict and disappointment are a given in a fast moving business where people care about their work. People that proactively have tough conversations with kindness build empathy, trust and great working relationships.
